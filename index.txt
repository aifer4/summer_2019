> `2fluid-v0.ipynb`
Computes source terms and $C_\ell$ spectrum for the two fluid model ($\Lambda$CDM with tight coupling between baryons and photons and no neutrinos). This implementation is almost exactly the same as in tristan's mathematica notebook. A key difference is that interpolation and normalization of the $C_\ell$ values is done differently to fix low-$\ell$ $C_\ell$ values. Computation of the mode evolutions and source  terms is pretty fast,  but the $C_\ell$ is slow. Computing $C_\ell$ from the source terms takes over a minute.

> '2fluid-v1.ipynb'
Computes source terms and $C_\ell$ spectrum for the two fluid model ($\Lambda$CDM with tight coupling between baryons and photons and no neutrinos). This implementation improves upon 2fluid_v0 by precomputing bessel functions and their derivatives, leading to a signficant speedup in computing the $C_\ell$ power spectrum. Also, $a_{eq}$ has been changed from OmegaGamma/OmegaM to OmegaRad/OmegaM.

> `3fluid-v0.ipynb`
Computes source terms and $C_\ell$ spectrum for the three fluid model (same as two fluid model but neutrinos are included).

directory with some files that are still in development (i.e. don't really work or aren't useful at the moment but aren't bad enough to be deleted).
